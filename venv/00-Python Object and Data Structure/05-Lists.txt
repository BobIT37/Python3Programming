Lists

Earlier when discussing strings we introduced the concept of a sequence
in Python. Lists can be thought of the most general version of a sequence
in Python. Unlike strings, they are mutable, meaning the elements inside
a list can be changed!

In this section we will learn about:
1.) Creating lists
2.) Indexing and Slicing Lists
3.) Basic List Methods
4.) Nesting Lists
5.) Introduction to List Comprehensions

Lists are constructed with brackets [] and commas separating every
element in the list.
