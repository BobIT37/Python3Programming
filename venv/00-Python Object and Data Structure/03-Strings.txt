Strings

Strings are used in Python to record text information, such as names.
Strings in Python are actually a sequence, which basically means
Python keeps track of every element in the string as a sequence.
For example, Python understands the string "hello' to be a sequence of letters
in a specific order. This means we will be able to use indexing
to grab particular letters (like the first letter, or the last letter).
This idea of a sequence is an important one in Python and
we will touch upon it later on in the future.

We'll learn about the following:
1.) Creating Strings
2.) Printing Strings
3.) String Indexing and Slicing
4.) String Properties
5.) String Methods
6.) Print Formatting
