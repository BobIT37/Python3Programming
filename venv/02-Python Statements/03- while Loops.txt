while Loops

The while statement in Python is one of most general ways to perform iteration. A while statement will
repeatedly execute a single statement or group of statements as long as the condition is true.
The reason it is called a 'loop' is because the code statements are looped through over and over again
until the condition is no longer met.

The general format of a while loop is:

while test:
    code statements
else:
    final code statements
