if, elif, else Statements

if Statements in Python allows us to tell the computer to perform alternative
actions based on a certain set of results.

Verbally, we can imagine we are telling the computer:
"Hey if this case happens, perform some action"

We can then expand the idea further with elif and else statements, which allow us to tell the computer:
"Hey if this case happens, perform some action. Else, if another case happens, perform
some other action. Else, if none of the above cases happened, perform this action."
Let's go ahead and look at the syntax format for if statements to get a better idea of this:

if case1:
    perform action1
elif case2:
    perform action2
else:
    perform action3
