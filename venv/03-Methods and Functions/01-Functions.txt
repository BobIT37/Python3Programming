Functions

Introduction to Functions

This lecture will consist of explaining what a function is in Python and how to create one.
Functions will be one of our main building blocks when we construct larger and larger amounts of code
to solve problems.

So what is a function?

Formally, a function is a useful device that groups together a set of statements so they can be run more than
once. They can also let us specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the functions.

On a more fundamental level, functions allow us to not have to repeatedly write the same code again and again.
If you remember back to the lessons on strings and lists, remember that we used a function len() to get
the length of a string. Since checking the length of a sequence is a common task you would want
to write a function that can do this repeatedly at command.

Functions will be one of most basic levels of reusing code in Python, and it will also allow us
to start thinking of program design (we will dive much deeper into the ideas of design
when we learn about Object Oriented Programming).
